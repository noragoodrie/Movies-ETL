The project at hand was all about extracting, transforming and loading data. Using very large csv files we were able to dive deeply into the datasets and extract our data, the clean our data then we were able to load our data into PgAdmin while merging the datasets together.

The bummer thing about this project was they fact that pushing the files to github from terminal was IMPOSSIBLE! The files were way too large and GitHub only allows a certain about of data to be loaded, therefore I just added the files in by hand from GitHub and it worked completely! Even in a quicker mannor. 

This assignment really helped grasp new skills and helped me feel confident in what I was being asked to do! (which is always a plus and somewhat unheard of)
